1.Separate the strings and numbers from the given array into two individual arrays and
strings should be sorted in the ascending order. Program should ignore float and
should print the count of the float.
Example:
const arr = [2.1,4, 'HYD', 8, 6.5, 5, â€œAC"];
Output:
Number : 4, 8, 5
Strings: AC, HYD
Float Count: 2
Answer:
arr = [2.1,4, 'HYD', 8, 6.5, 5, 'AC'];
alpha=[]
floatnum=[]
intnumb=[]
for i in arr:
 if type(i)==float:
 floatnum.append(i)
 elif type(i)==int:
 intnumb.append(i)
 else:
 alpha.append(i)
print("Numbers: "+str(intnumb))
print("Strings: "+str(alpha))
print("Float Count: "+str(len(floatnum))

2.Identify first smallest duplicate number from the given array, print the index of the
smallest duplicate number and the value.
Example:
const arr = [7, 1, 2, 4, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 0];
Output
2 is smallest among them and index is 2

Answers:
arr = [7, 1, 2, 4, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 0]
duplicatenum=[]
for i in arr:
    if arr.count(i)==2:
        duplicatenum.append(i)
minimun=min(duplicatenum)
print(str(minimun)+" is the smallest among them and index is "+str(arr.index(minimun)))

3.Count the total number of alphabets, digits, special characters and identify the
character which repeated for the maximum number of times for the string
"Programming Website 123.com"
Output :
Numbers: 3
Alphabets: 21
Special character: 4
Max repeated character : m

Answers:
word="Programming Website 123.com"
print(len(word))
def count_num(word):
    count={}
    for i in word:
        if i in count:
            count[i]+=1
        else:
            count[i] = 1
    return count
Alphabets=0
Numbers=0
Special_character=0

for i in word:
    if i.isdigit():
        Numbers+=1
    elif i.isalpha():
        Alphabets+=1
    else:
        Special_character+=1
words=count_num(word)
print("Numbers: "+str(Numbers))
print("Alphabets: "+str(Alphabets))
print("Special_character: "+str(Special_character))
max_count = 0
max_alpha = ''
for j in words:
    if words[i] > max_count:
        max_count = words[i]
        max_alpha = i
print("Max repeated character : "+ (max_alpha))
Note: I have got only three special characters but you mention was 3 
For my answer the length of string was 27 by removing the alphabets and numbers the remaining are special characters then also I got the 3 so I get the 3 as answer plz check the question u have given wrong or I have wort wrong

4.Find the all the possible pairs of number from the given array wherein sum of the two
numbers are equal
Example:
var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]

AlpineCode - Confidential 1 of 2

Output
[[9,0],[8,1],[7,2],[6,3],[5,4]]

Answers:
array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
maxnum=max(array)
num_pairs=[]
for i in range(len(array)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(array)):
        if array[i]+array[j]==maxnum:
            p=(array[i],array[j])
            num_pairs.append(p)
print(num_pairs)
